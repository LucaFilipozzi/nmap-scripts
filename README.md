nmap-scripts
============

This repository contains my new or modified Nmap scripts.
Depeding on how good or useful they are, they might even get added into the
official repository.

Contents:

- ssl-enum-ciphers - a modified NSE script that enumerates SSL ciphers. The
  script now also retrieves the preferred order of ciphers of a server so
  you can verify that the order is correct/most secure.
